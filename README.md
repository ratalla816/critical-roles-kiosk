# Description

## What:
A web application that can be easily accessed by any web-enabled device (phone, computer, tablet, etc) inside or outside of the facility that allows associates to sign up for critical roles training. 

## Why:
The goal is to close all critical role gaps within the next 90 days and create an applicant funnel that can be followed up on later for those that do not currently meet vetting criteria.

## Who:
All tier 1â€™s may apply.

## How:
The associate scans a QR code located at multiple locations near the entrance, break room, and start up area which brings up the application.
<br>
The associates are able to review the various critical role descriptions listed on the website. Once they have picked which roles that interest them, they fill out the form on the bottom of the page indicating their login, which roles they want, and their UPT balance. 
<br>
Once submitted, an email is sent to leadership containing all the information submitted in the form which managers use for vetting.

## When:
Starting on or around February 27th

## Where:
QR code signage located at multiple locations near the entrance, break room, and start up area.
